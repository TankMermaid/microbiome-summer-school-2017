# Conclusion

## What if I don't use Python?

One of the objectives of this tutorial is that you learn how to apply machine learning algorithms, regardless of the programming language being used. Although most of the state-of-the-art machine learning research is done in Python, here are some machine learning packages in other languages:

* R: [see here](https://www.r-bloggers.com/what-are-the-best-machine-learning-packages-in-r/)
* Java: [see here](http://machinelearningmastery.com/java-machine-learning/)
* Graphical User Interface: 
  * [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/services/machine-learning/)
  * [Orange](https://orange.biolab.si/)
  * [Weka](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/)

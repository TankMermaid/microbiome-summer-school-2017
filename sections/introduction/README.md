# Introduction

## Overview of our toolbox

This tutorial is an introduction to machine learning in Python. We will rely heavily on the scikit-learn and numpy packages. Scikit-learn will be used for implementing machine learning protocols and learning algorithms, whereas numpy will be used to manipulate matrices of data.

## Getting started

Explain where to find the code and the data. How the practical session will be organized.

## Objectives

After completing this tutorial, you should have acquired the following skills:
* Using Python to apply machine learning algorithms to data sets.
* Understanding the various types of problems (regression, classification)
* Perform machine learning experiments using correct protocols.
* Applying learning algorithms to biological data

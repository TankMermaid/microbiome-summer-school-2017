### Application: peptide protein binding affinity prediction

Use a data set from the work of Gigu√®re et al. to show them a sequence-based regression problem. Use various algorithms: decision tree regression, kernel SVM and nearest neighbour. Benchmark their prediction accuracy using figures and make them notice the key differences between the algorithms. Explain why some work better than the others.
